## What is a Campaign ?

Campaigns form the core of QCall Ai. They are the final step where we ask the [assistant](https://app.qcall.ai/admin/assistants) to call all the users in a [contact list](https://app.qcall.ai/admin/contact-list) using the [segments](https://app.qcall.ai/admin/segments) we provide. It’s like magic! 🪄 Campaigns bring everything together—your segment, saved contacts, and assistant—to create amazing results.

## How to CREATE a campaign ?

## Follow these Steps to Create a Campaign:

1. Click on the Campaigns option under Call Platforms.
2. Select Add New.
3. Enter the following details:
   - Campaign Name
   - Voice Assistant
   - Dialer
   - Segment List
4. Turn on the optional settings as desired:
   - Automation
   - Scheduled
   - Retry (if failed)
5. Click the Start button.
6. A prompt will appear asking, "Do you want to start the XYZ campaign?"
   - Choose Cancel or Confirm.
7. Once you confirm, the campaign will be successfully created.

👏👏 Now you're ready to launch your campaign and see the magic happen! 🎉🎉
