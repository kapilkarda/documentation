## Knowledge Base

QCall AI is a next-generation conversational AI assistant designed to enhance customer service. It is created to be a friendly and helpful companion for customers.

One of the key features of QCall AI is its Knowledge Base. This feature allows you, as the business owner, to easily add and manage important information about your company, such as FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), product documentation, and other valuable details.

The Knowledge Base ensures that the AI assistant is always equipped with the necessary knowledge to respond accurately and helpfully to customer inquiries. When a customer interacts with the AI assistant, it can quickly access the information stored in the Knowledge Base to provide the customer with the answers and information they need.

In summary, the Knowledge Base feature of QCall AI allows you to easily manage and maintain a centralised repository of information, which the AI assistant can then use to engage with customers knowledgeably and helpfully. This can enhance customer satisfaction and support the overall effectiveness of your customer service efforts.
