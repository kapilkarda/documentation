title: Fine-tuning & Custom LLMs
---

## Summary

QCall Ai would train a custom model specifically for your business using transcripts from your successful past calls. This is again followed by them hosting that model and supplying you with all the infrastructure in place to enable phone conversations with ultra-low latency.

QCall Ai will also allow one to connect directly to a custom (LLMs) language model, and it will host that model to reduce those delays even further.

## Background on fine-tuning

Typically, standard telephone AI systems are driven by off-the-shelf language models from major tech companies. These models, sure, can be impressive, yet they come with huge downsides: they are super slow, and their personality and tone are pretty much not there because they are built for general purposes. On the other hand, open-source language models can be finely tuned to specific tasks. Training these models with relevant examples makes their performance for that specific task go through the roof, outperforming most advanced commercial models by some margin.

This is where QCall Ai comes in. They specialize in fine-tuning open-source language models to meet each client's unique needs. It is in this way that QCall Ai can generate AI phone agents that would be capable of answering at speeds faster than what is humanly possible at the moment. Their personality will be tailored and fully customized with client-specific data, fitting the model in the right way for their application.
